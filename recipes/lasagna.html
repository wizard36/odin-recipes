        <h2 class="lasagna-subhead">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles 
                    according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles and set them aside.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until it's 
                    browned. Add the onion and garlic and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes,
                    or until the onion is translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper.
                    Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, or until
                    it has thickened slightly.</li>
                <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom
                    of the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of the cooked lasagna noodles, 
                    followed by another layer of sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan 
                    cheese. Repeat the layers until all of the ingredients are used up, ending 
                    with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake the lasagna for 30 minutes.
                    Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the 
                    cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
